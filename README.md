# Geographic-information-system

Proposed an efficient cycle path solution within the Leicestershire area.
Utilised GRASS Geographical information system which provided data management tools, graphs and maps production, 
visualization, image processing, and spatial modelling functionalities. Used relevant geographical layers to ensure all client requirements were met.
